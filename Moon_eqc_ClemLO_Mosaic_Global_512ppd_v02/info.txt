Abstract :The is a blend of the Clementine UVVIS mosaic and the Lunar
                            Oribiter mosaic. The Clementine 750 nm Version 2 mosaic is a greyscale
                            data set representing the albedo(brightness of the lunar surface) as
                            measured at the 750 nm wavelength by the UVVIS camera. This lunar base
                            map is a radiometrically and geometrically controlled, photometrically
                            modeled global image mosaic compiled using more than 43,000 images from
                            the 750 nanometer filter observations of the UVVIS. The Five Lunar
                            Orbiter missions were launched by the U.S. in 1966 and 1967 to study the
                            Moon. Lunar Orbiter images were photographic products acquired on the
                            spacecraft during those five missions (LO-I through -V; Hansen, 1970;
                            Bowker and Hughes, 1971). The first three missions mapped potential
                            Apollo lunar landing sites. Lunar Orbiter IV photographed most of the
                            near and far sides of the Moon medium- and high-resolutions. Lunar
                            Orbiter V completed the photography of the far side and collected
                            additional images of 36 sites of scientific interest.
