Abstract :The Clementine 750 nm Version 2 mosaic is a greyscale data set
                            representing the albedo (brightness of the lunar surface) as measured at
                            the 750 nm wavelength by the UVVIS camera. This lunar base map is a
                            radiometrically and geometrically controlled, photometrically modeled
                            global image mosaic compiled using more than 43,000 images from the 750
                            nanometer filter observations of the UVVIS. The Clementine experiment
                            carried four scientific imaging cameras: the Ultraviolet/Visible
                            (UVVIS), Near-Infrared (NIR), High-Resolution (HiRES), and Long-wave
                            Infrared (LWIR) cameras. The Ultraviolet/Visible (UVVIS) camera imaged
                            the surface of the Moon at five wavelengths spanning the ultraviolet to
                            near-infrared spectrum and the Near-Infrared (NIR) camera collected data
                            at six wavelengths extending into the short-wave infrared. This
                            experiment yielded information on the color and inferred compositional
                            properties of lunar soils and surface units, and also provided images
                            useful for morphologic studies and cratering statistics. Most images
                            were taken at low Sun angles, which is useful for compositional studies
                            but not for observing morphology. Global mosaics at the five UVVIS and
                            six NIR coregistered wavelengths were created using nearly 1 million
                            images and are displayed here at a resolution of approximately 100
                            m/pixel.
