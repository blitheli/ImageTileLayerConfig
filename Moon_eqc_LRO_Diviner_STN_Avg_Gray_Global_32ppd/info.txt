Abstract :Each sample represents the deviation of rock-free regolith surface
        temperature derived from the global average for each local time as
        estimated using the technique described in Bandfield et al. (2011).  Data from diviner spectral channels 6, 7, and 8 were binned at 32
        pixels per degree in ten separate one hour increments of local time
        from 1930 to 0530. For each local time, the longitudinally averaged
        regolith temperatures were calculated and filtered using a 401 sample
        boxcar filter to remove local latitudinal variations.  The
        longitudinal average regolith temperature for each local time was
        subtracted from the regolith temperatures to produce a deviation from
        the longitudinal average, allowing for values between separate local
        time observations to be comparable and removing the latitudinal
        temperature gradient. For each spatial bin, all retrieved values for
        the ten local times were averaged to produce a single map.
