Abstract :This is a colorized map of the original north polar surface slope of the Moon at a resolution of 16 m/pix by 16 m/pix, based on altimetry data acquired by the LOLA instrument. The LOLA Laser 1 and 2 data through mission phase LRO_SM_17 are the source for this data set. The bi-directional slope was calculated from a plane fit to three successive laser shots requiring n=5 to 15 profile returns. Depending on orbital velocity, probability of detection, and spacecraft altitude, the slope baseline may vary from 30 to 120 meters.
这是一张基于LOLA仪器获取的测高数据的月球原始北极表面斜率的彩色地图，分辨率为16米/像素乘16米/象素。通过任务阶段LRO_SM_17的LOLA激光器1和2数据是该数据集的来源。双向斜率是从平面拟合到需要n＝5到15个轮廓返回的三个连续激光发射来计算的。根据轨道速度、探测概率和航天器高度的不同，斜率基线可能在30米至120米之间变化。
