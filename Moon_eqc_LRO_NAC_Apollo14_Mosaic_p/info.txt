Abstract : This is the site where American astronauts Alan Shepard and Edgar Mitchell made the third human landing on the Moon on February 5, 1971. Shepard and Mitchell landed here aboard the lunar module Antares, while Stuart Roosa remained in orbit around the Moon in the command module Kitty Hawk. Shephard and Mitchell conducted 2 EVAs on the lunar surface. The first, lasting 4 hours, 47 minutes, 50 seconds, extended to the west for deployment of the ALSEP instrument package, included collection of a contingency sample, and covered a total distance of about 550 meters. The second EVA, lasting 4 hours, 34 minutes, 41 seconds, was intended to visit Cone Crater, 370 meters in diameter and located approximately 1.2 kilometers to the northeast. To help transport the load of equipment and retrieved samples on this EVA, the astronauts were equipped with a hand-pulled cart, the Modular Equipment Transporter (MET). The rough, hummocky terrain made navigation difficult during the second EVA, and the astronauts were not able to identify the rim of Cone Crater, though later imagery showed that they reached a point about 20 meters south of the crater rim. Shepard and Mitchell collected 42.80 kilograms of lunar sample material for return to the Earth. In this LRO NAC view of the landing site, the descent stage of the Antares is the largest man-made object visible. The dark tracks of the astronauts’ footprints from the first EVA extend to the west, where components of the ALSEP are visible. Extending to the northeast of Antares’ landing site, the track of the astronauts’ footprints and the tracks of the MET’s wheels can be traced toward Cone Crater. The landing site, located at 3.64589 S, 17.47194 W, was selected largely with the goal of sampling material from the Imbrium Basin impact, whose ejecta covers much of this area, known as the Fra Mauro formation.
1971年2月5日，美国宇航员艾伦·谢泼德和埃德加·米切尔在这里进行了人类第三次登月。谢泼德和米切尔乘坐“心宿二”号登月舱降落在这里，斯图尔特·鲁萨则乘坐“基蒂霍克”号指挥舱留在绕月轨道上。Shephard和Mitchell在月球表面进行了2次EVAs。第一次持续4小时47分50秒，向西延伸以部署ALSEP仪器包，包括收集应急样本，总距离约550米。第二次EVA持续4小时34分41秒，旨在访问直径370米、位于东北约1.2公里处的锥形陨石坑。为了帮助运送EVA上的设备和取回的样本，宇航员们配备了一辆手动推车，即模块化设备运输车（MET）。在第二次EVA飞行中，崎岖不平的地形使导航变得困难，宇航员无法识别锥形陨石坑的边缘，尽管后来的图像显示他们到达了陨石坑边缘以南约20米的地方。Shepard和Mitchell收集了42.80公斤月球样本材料，准备返回地球。在LRO NAC的着陆场视图中，心宿二的下降阶段是可见的最大的人造物体。宇航员的脚印从第一个EVA延伸到西方，在那里可以看到ALSEP的组成部分。延伸到心宿二着陆点的东北部，宇航员的足迹和MET轮子的轨迹可以追溯到锥形陨石坑。着陆点位于3.64589 S，17.47194 W，主要是为了对Imbrium盆地撞击的物质进行采样，其喷出物覆盖了该地区的大部分地区，即Fra Mauro地层。
