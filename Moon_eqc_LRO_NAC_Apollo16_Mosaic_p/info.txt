Abstract : This is the site where American astronauts John Young and Charles Duke made the fifth human landing on the Moon on April 21, 1972. Young and Duke landed here aboard the lunar module Orion, while Ken Mattingly remained in orbit around the Moon in the command module Casper. Young and Duke conducted 3 surface EVAs. The first, lasting 7 hours, 11 minutes, 2 seconds, included deploying the Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package (ALSEP) approximately 95 meters southwest of the lunar module, and conducting a geologic traverse using the lunar rover to a couple of small craters within about 1,400 meters to the west of the landing site. The second surface EVA, lasting 7 hours, 23 minutes, 9 seconds, featured an 11.1-kilometer lunar rover drive south to the Cinco Crater area of Stone Mountain, making stops at 6 stations along the way. across the mare and along the base of the Apennine Mountains. The third surface EVA, lasting 5 hours, 40 minutes, 3 seconds, had the astronauts making a 11.4-kilometer traverse north to North Ray Crater. Young and Duke collected 95.71 kilograms of lunar sample material for return to the Earth. In this LRO NAC view of the landing site, the descent stage of the Orion is the largest man-made object visible, within a dark halo on the western rim of a ~30-meter crater. The dark markings of the astronauts’ footprints and rover tire tracks are visible around the landing site, especially extending to the southwest, where components of the ALSEP are visible. With the previous Apollo landings having focused on the low, flat, basaltic terrain of the lunar maria or seas, Apollo 16 was the first crewed mission to visit the lunar highlands. The landing site, located at 8.9734 S, 15.5011 E, was located on the boundary of two highland geologic units, the Descartes Formation and the Cayley Formation. Both units were thought to be volcanic in nature, but composed of lavas with higher silica content than the basaltic rocks of the maria; the Descartes Formation was widely thought to be rhyolite. However, the astronauts quickly discovered on their traverses that the rocks around them were overwhelmingly breccias. The great surprise of Apollo 16 was the discovery that the highland terrain was not silicic lava, but fluidized ejecta from a great basin-forming impact, an that the rocks were crustal material, largely anorthosite and gabbro.
1972年4月21日，美国宇航员约翰·杨和查尔斯·杜克在这里进行了人类第五次登月。杨和杜克乘坐猎户座登月舱降落在这里，而肯·马丁利则乘坐卡斯珀号指挥舱留在绕月轨道上。Young和Duke进行了3次地面EVA。第一次持续7小时11分2秒，包括在登月舱西南约95米处部署阿波罗月球表面实验包（ALSEP），并使用月球车对着陆点以西约1400米范围内的几个小陨石坑进行地质穿越。第二个表面EVA持续了7小时23分9秒，其特点是一辆11.1公里长的月球车向南行驶到石山的辛科陨石坑地区，沿途停靠了6个站点。穿过母马，沿着亚平宁山脉的底部。第三个表面EVA持续了5小时40分3秒，宇航员向北穿越了11.4公里到达北雷陨石坑。杨和杜克收集了95.71公斤月球样本材料，准备返回地球。在LRO NAC拍摄的着陆场视图中，猎户座的下降阶段是可见的最大的人造物体，位于约30米陨石坑西部边缘的黑暗光环内。着陆场周围可以看到宇航员脚印和火星车轮胎痕迹的深色标记，尤其是延伸到西南部，在那里可以看到ALSEP的组件。由于之前的阿波罗登陆都集中在月球玛丽亚或海洋的低、平坦、玄武岩地形上，阿波罗16号是第一次访问月球高地的载人任务。着陆点位于南8.9734，东经15.5011，位于笛卡尔组和凯利组这两个高地地质单元的边界上。这两个单元都被认为是火山性质的，但由二氧化硅含量高于玛丽亚玄武岩的熔岩组成；笛卡尔组被广泛认为是流纹岩。然而，宇航员们在穿越时很快发现，他们周围的岩石绝大多数是角砾岩。阿波罗16号的最大惊喜是发现高地地形不是硅化熔岩，而是形成盆地的巨大撞击产生的流化喷出物，岩石是地壳物质，主要是斜长岩和辉长岩。
