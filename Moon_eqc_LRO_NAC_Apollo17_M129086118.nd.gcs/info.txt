Abstract : This is the site where American astronauts Eugene Cernan and Harrison Schmitt made the sixth and final human landing on the Moon of the Apollo program on December 11, 1972. Cernan and Schmitt landed here aboard the lunar module Challenger, while Ronald Evans remained in orbit around the Moon in the command module America. With a PhD in geology, Schmitt was the first and only professional scientist to have visited the Moon. Cernan and Schmitt conducted 3 surface EVAs. The first, lasting 7 hours, 11 minutes, 53 seconds, included deploying the Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package (ALSEP) approximately 185 meters west-northwest of the lunar module, and conducting a 3.5-kilometer geologic traverse using the lunar rover to the rim of Steno, a small impact crater south of the landing site. The second surface EVA, lasting 7 hours, 36 minutes, 56 seconds, featured a 20.4-kilometer geologic traverse south and west. Stops included a location at the base of South Massif where a landslide had brought ancient highland rocks from high on the mountain into reach, and at Shorty Crater, which was found to be impact rather than volcanic in origin, but which excavated an older volcanic deposit which yielded the famous “orange soil”, beads of volcanic glass erupted in a lunar fire fountain. The third surface EVA, lasting 7 hours, 15 minutes, 8 seconds, had the astronauts making a 20.4-kilometer geologic traverse north and east to North Massif. Stops on this traverse included taking samples of early lunar crust material from large boulders near the base of the massif that had rolled down from high up on the mountain. Cernan and Schmitt collected 110.52 kilograms of lunar sample material for return to the Earth. In this LRO NAC view of the landing site, the descent stage of the Challenger is the largest man-made object visible. The dark markings of the astronauts’ footprints and rover tire tracks are visible around the landing site, especially extending to the west-northwest, where components of the ALSEP are visible. The landing site, located at 20.1911 N, 30.7723 E, is in a narrow valley in the Taurus Mountains near the crater Littrow. The Taurus Mountains form part of the Serenitatis impact basin, and sampling some of the ancient highland terrain into which the basin was excavated could help determine the date of the basin’s formation. Mare basalt subsequently flooded the floor of the valley, and after that parts of the area were blanketed by pyroclastic ash deposits erupting from dark-haloed volcanic craters. The site could therefore provide access to a diverse range of sample material.
1972年12月11日，美国宇航员尤金·塞尔南和哈里森·施密特在这里进行了阿波罗计划的第六次也是最后一次登月。塞尔南和施密特乘坐挑战者号登月舱降落在这里，罗纳德·埃文斯则乘坐美国号指挥舱留在绕月轨道上。施密特拥有地质学博士学位，是第一位也是唯一一位访问过月球的专业科学家。Cernan和Schmitt进行了3次表面EVAs。第一次持续7小时11分53秒，包括在登月舱西北偏西约185米处部署阿波罗月球表面实验包（ALSEP），并使用月球车对着陆点以南的小撞击坑Steno边缘进行3.5公里的地质穿越。第二个表面EVA持续7小时36分56秒，向南和向西穿越20.4公里的地质。停靠点包括南地块底部的一个位置，那里的山体滑坡将山上的古老高地岩石带到了可以到达的地方，以及Shorty火山口，该火山口被发现是撞击而非火山成因，但它挖掘了一个古老的火山沉积物，产生了著名的“橙色土壤”，火山玻璃珠在月球喷泉中喷发。第三个表面EVA持续了7小时15分8秒，宇航员们向北和向东进行了20.4公里的地质穿越，到达了north Massif。这次穿越的停止包括从山体底部附近的巨石上采集早期月球地壳物质的样本，这些巨石是从山上高处滚落下来的。塞尔南和施密特收集了110.52公斤月球样本材料，准备返回地球。在LRO NAC的着陆场视图中，挑战者号的下降阶段是可见的最大的人造物体。着陆场周围可以看到宇航员脚印和火星车轮胎痕迹的深色标记，尤其是延伸到西北偏西，在那里可以看到ALSEP的组件。着陆点位于北纬20.1911，东经30.7723，位于利特罗环形山附近的金牛座山脉的一个狭窄山谷中。金牛座山脉是Serenitatis撞击盆地的一部分，对盆地被挖掘到的一些古老高地地形进行采样可以帮助确定盆地的形成日期。Mare玄武岩随后淹没了山谷的底部，之后该地区的部分地区被深色卤代火山口喷发的火山碎屑灰沉积物覆盖。因此，该网站可以提供各种各样的样本材料。
