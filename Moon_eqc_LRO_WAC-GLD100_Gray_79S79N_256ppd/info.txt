Abstract :This is a grayscale image version of the 256 pixel/degree (ppd, ~118 meter/pixel) WAC Digital Elevation Model (DEM) which was constructed from Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) Wide Angle Camera (WAC) stereo images. This DEM was derived from the original DLR 100 m topographic model, or &quot;GLD100&quot;, and covers 98.2% of the lunar surface and combined with the LRO Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter (LOLA) polar gridded DEM for the areas not covered. Using digital photogrammetric techniques the GLD100 was computed from 69,000 WAC stereo models. Due to persistent shadows near the poles it is not possible to create a complete WAC stereo map at the very highest latitudes. The GLD100 thus covers from 79&#176; S latitude to 79&#176; N latitude. Since the stereo correlation box is bigger than 100 meters, surface details at the 100-meter scale are not fully resolved. However, each 100-meter square has an average of 26 stereo points within it (for a planet-wide total of 100 billion points), which helps to sharpen the elevation estimate. The resolution, in a formal sense, is probably close to 300 meters, and the accuracy of the elevations is estimated to be about 10 to 20 meters (Scholten et al JGR in press). The LRO Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter (LOLA) excels at characterizing the topography of the poles since the LRO orbits converge at the poles. Thus for this WAC DEM, LOLA polar gridded elevation data was used to fill from 79 to 90 and -90 to -79 latitudes.
这是256像素/度（ppd，~118米/像素）WAC数字高程模型（DEM）的灰度图像版本，该模型由月球勘测轨道飞行器（LRO）广角相机（WAC）立体图像构建而成。该DEM来源于原始DLR 100米地形模型；GLD100”；，并覆盖了98.2%的月球表面，并与LRO月球轨道飞行器激光高度表（LOLA）结合用于未覆盖区域的极网格DEM。使用数字摄影测量技术，从69000个WAC立体模型中计算出GLD100。由于两极附近持续存在阴影，因此无法在最高纬度创建完整的WAC立体图。GLD100因此覆盖了79&#176；北纬79&#176；北纬。由于立体相关框大于100米，因此无法完全解析100米尺度下的表面细节。然而，每100米的正方形内平均有26个立体点（全球共有1000亿个点）
