Abstract :This mosaic represents the abundance of iron (Fe) on the surface of the Moon, expressed as weight percent of iron oxide (FeO wt%).

The mosaic was created from the topographically corrected MI reflectance data acquired of the Moon by the JAXA SELENE/Kaguya mission (Ohtake, M., C.M. Pieters, P. Isaacson, S. Besse, Y. Yokota, T. Matsunaga, J. Boardman, S. Yamamoto, J. Haruyama, M. Staid, U. Mall, R.O. Green [2013], One Moon, Many Measurements 3: Spectral reflectance, Icarus, Volume 226, Issue 1, 364â374) from the Kaguya Archive MI MAP processing level version 2 (MI MAP_02). The original MI product of 1x1 degree mosaics at 2048 ppd (15 m/p) data was resampled during processing to 512 ppd (59 m/p). The MI ultraviolet-visible (UVVIS) data (5 spectral bands, at 415, 750, 900, 950, 1001 nm) were used to derive 9 new near-global maps of common lunar minerals, FeO, and optical maturity (OMAT) using Hapkeâs radiative transfer equations (Lemelin, M., Lucey, P.G., L.R. Gaddis, T. Hare, and M. Ohtake, 2019, Global map products from the Kaguya Multiband Imager at 512 ppd: Minerals, FeO and OMAT, Planetary and Space Science 165 (2019) 230â243). This product only covers the latitudinal range +/-50 degrees due to the difficulty of applying adequate corrections for topographic shading at higher latitudes.

The mosaic presented here has been resampled to 512 ppd (59 meters/pixel) from its original resolution of 2048 ppd (15 meters/pixel).
