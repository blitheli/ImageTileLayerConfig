Abstract :This mosaic represents the weighted criteria values associated with a collection of near-global lunar mineral maps produced by Lemelin et al using data from the Kaguya Multiband Imager (MI). The weighted criteria value provides a measure of the amount of agreement between the reflectance spectrum of a given pixel and the closest matching spectrum from a library of 92,414 synthetic spectral mixtures. To determine the winning composition between multiple spectral library entries, each MI spectrum was compared to the library spectra that have within +/- 2 wt.% FeO of that pixel and the weighted criteria for each corresponding spectral library entry was calculated as follows: (1-correlation) + (absolute difference of continuum removed reflectance).

The winning composition was assigned to the lowest weighted criteria value. Thus smaller weighted criteria values correspond to closer matches between the observed spectrum and the library spectrum.

The mosaic was created from the topographically corrected MI reflectance data acquired of the Moon by the JAXA SELENE/Kaguya mission (Ohtake, M., C.M. Pieters, P. Isaacson, S. Besse, Y. Yokota, T. Matsunaga, J. Boardman, S. Yamamoto, J. Haruyama, M. Staid, U. Mall, R.O. Green [2013], One Moon, Many Measurements 3: Spectral reflectance, Icarus, Volume 226, Issue 1, 364â374) from the Kaguya Archive MI MAP processing level version 2 (MI MAP_02). The original MI product of 1x1 degree mosaics at 2048 ppd (15 m/p) data was resampled during processing to 512 ppd (59 m/p). The MI ultraviolet-visible (UVVIS) data (5 spectral bands, at 415, 750, 900, 950, 1001 nm) were used to derive 9 new near-global maps of common lunar minerals, FeO, and optical maturity (OMAT) using Hapkeâs radiative transfer equations (Lemelin, M., Lucey, P.G., L.R. Gaddis, T. Hare, and M. Ohtake, 2019, Global map products from the Kaguya Multiband Imager at 512 ppd: Minerals, FeO and OMAT, Planetary and Space Science 165 (2019) 230â243). This product only covers the latitudinal range +/-50 degrees due to the difficulty of applying adequate corrections for topographic shading at higher latitudes.

The mosaic presented here has been resampled to 512 ppd (59 meters/pixel) from its original resolution of 2048 ppd (15 meters/pixel).

该镶嵌图代表了与Lemelin等人使用Kaguya多波段成像仪（MI）的数据制作的一组近全球月球矿物图相关的加权标准值。加权标准值提供了给定像素的反射光谱与来自92414个合成光谱混合物库的最接近匹配光谱之间的一致程度的度量。为了确定多个光谱库条目之间的获胜成分，将每个MI光谱与该像素的FeO在+/-2 wt.%范围内的库光谱进行比较，并计算每个相应光谱库条目的加权标准如下：（1-相关性）+（连续去除反射率的绝对差）。
