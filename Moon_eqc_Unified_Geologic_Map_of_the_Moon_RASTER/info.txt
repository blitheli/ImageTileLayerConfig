Abstract :This new work represents a seamless, globally consistent, 1:5,000,000-scale geologic map derived from the six digitally renovated geologic maps (see Source Online Linkage below). The goal of this project was to create a digital resource for science research and analysis, future geologic mapping efforts, be it local-, regional-, or global-scale products, and as a resource for the educators and the public interested in lunar geology. Here we present the completed mapping project as unit contacts, geologic unit polygons, linear features, and unit and feature nomenclature annotation. The product overlies shaded-relief products derived from SELENE Kaguya terrain camera stereo (equatorial, &tilde;60 m/pix) and LOLA altimetry (north and south polar, 100 m/pix). These data are not included with this download due to size considerations, but a readme in the &quot;Lunar_Raster&quot; folder provides the download links. This download page includes a PDF of the geologic map (right-side) with a brief Description of Map Units and Explanation of Map Symbols, as well as a JPG of the map for quick access viewing. This release is subject to update based on community feedback and peer-review.

Version 2 updates: Two errors were addressed in this update: (1) Large area polygons were offset from their contacts, likely due to user error. Polygons were rebuilt to fix the issue and post processing (dissolving, reattributing, etc.) to rectify the aesthetic of the map. (2) Contacts were not visible but should have been due to incorrect labeling as DND (do not draw). Those that needed to be drawn have been reattributed as &quot;certain&quot; those that are not drawn are labeled as &quot;internal&quot;. Additionally, in version 1 of this data, crater polygons with similar attributes had been dissolved and lumped into contiguous units. This has been changed so that all craters are now discrete units. This adds ~1000 units to the GeoUnits featureclass and the related contacts are now visible and labeled as &quot;certain&quot;.
这幅新作品代表了一幅无缝的、全球一致的1:5000000比例尺的地质图，该地质图来源于六幅数字翻新的地质图（见下文的在线链接来源）。该项目的目标是创建一个数字资源，用于科学研究和分析，未来的地质测绘工作，无论是地方、区域还是全球范围的产品，并作为对月球地质感兴趣的教育工作者和公众的资源。在这里，我们将完成的地图绘制项目作为单元接触、地质单元多边形、线性特征以及单元和特征命名注释。该产品覆盖了SELENE Kaguya地形相机立体（赤道，&tilde；60 m/pix）和LOLA测高（北极和南极，100 m/pix。由于大小的考虑，这些数据不包括在该下载中，而是“；Lunar_主控器”；文件夹提供了下载链接。这个下载页面包括地质图的PDF（右侧）和一个简介
