Abstract :Mare Ingenii is notable for being one of the few examples of a mare on the far side of the Moon, and the site for notable lunar swirls, enigmatic bright albedo features. This was enough to qualify the area as a Constellation Region of Interest. However, the area became even more interesting with the discovery of a lunar pit in imagery obtained using the Kaguya Terrain Camera. It measures about 130 m in diameter, and researchers speculate that the pit could be a skylight resulting from the collapse of the roof of a lava tube. Whether this is actually the case, and if so, the accessibility and extent of the lava tube have yet to be determined. However, such lava tubes are of great interest as potential locations for lunar bases, offering protection from extreme swings in temperature, galactic and solar radiation, and meteoroid impacts. This data layer was obtained using the Narrow Angle Camera aboard the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter and is a is a mosaic of 2 NAC strips centered on the Mare Ingenii pit.
英格尼号是月球背面为数不多的母马之一，也是著名的月球漩涡和神秘明亮反照率特征的所在地。这足以使该地区成为感兴趣的星座地区。然而，随着使用卡古亚地形相机获得的图像中发现了一个月球坑，该地区变得更加有趣。它的直径约为130米，研究人员推测，这个坑可能是熔岩管顶部坍塌形成的天窗。事实是否如此，如果是这样，熔岩管的可达性和范围还有待确定。然而，这种熔岩管作为月球基地的潜在位置，提供了保护，免受温度、银河系和太阳辐射以及流星体撞击的极端波动。该数据层是使用月球勘测轨道飞行器上的窄角相机获得的，是以Ma为中心的2个NAC带的马赛克
