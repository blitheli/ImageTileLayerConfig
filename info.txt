Abstract : The Apollo 16 digital image mosaic is stored as 8-bit signed integer at 7.4m/pixel (4096ppd) resolution. The invalid pixels are marked with 0 value. Value 255 is left unused. The mosaicking process includes an upsampling post processing step. The mosaic is generated using the Ames Stereo Pipeline: a software tool produced by the NASA Ames Intelligent Robotics Group (IRG) for automated processing of stereo imagery.
